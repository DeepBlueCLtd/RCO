## Burndown Chart

The cumulative height of the chart is the overall amount of work to be done for RCO, starting on 24th July. The green area is the volume of work completed, the red area is the volume of work pending, and the red line is the trend for the remaining work - which will eventually forecast the completion date.

As the data sample grows, the trend line will become more valuable.
